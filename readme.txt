Customise (override) the text labels for any registered custom post type using a simple Dashboard user interface.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a simple to use Dashboard interface. No PHP file editing is necessary!

For example, you could customise the following Custom Post Types:

* The `Posts` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* The `Pages` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* The `Media` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* The `Revisions` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* Any Custom Post Type that is created by a WordPress plugin
* Any Custom Post Type that is created by a WordPress theme

This means that you no longer have to modify PHP files in order to rename a Custom Post Type! Using this plugin, you can now make those changes using a simple interface in your WordPress dashboard. See the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cpt-editor/screenshots/) for details.

* Want to rename `Posts` to `Blog Posts`?
* Want to rename `Media` to `Uploads`?
* Want to rename the WooThemesâ€™ `Features` post type to `Tours`?

You can do all of this (and more) using this plugin.
